This variant requires python, pillow, tkinter, and struct to run.

This project is still in it's early days, so don't expect much out of it.
This program should convert your transparent .png files into custom .cur (windows cursor) files.

I plan on adding animated .png to .ani conversion later on, but it kinda sucks now.
the .ani files produced from the conversion aren't functional...
